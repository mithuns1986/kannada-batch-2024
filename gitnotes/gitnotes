GitHub is a web-based platform that provides version control using **Git**. It allows developers to host, share, and manage software projects collaboratively. Key features of GitHub include:

1. **Repositories (Repos)**: These are project spaces where code and other files are stored. Developers can track all versions of the project files over time.
2. **Version Control**: GitHub uses Git to keep track of changes in files, allowing multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's work.
3. **Branches**: Developers can create branches to work on different features or bug fixes independently of the main codebase, and then merge changes back in later.
4. **Pull Requests**: Developers can propose changes to a repository, allowing team members to review the changes before merging them into the main branch.
5. **Issues and Discussions**: GitHub also allows developers to track bugs, suggest enhancements, and discuss project-related topics in a structured way.
6. **Actions and CI/CD**: GitHub supports automation through GitHub Actions, allowing you to set up continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) workflows directly on the platform.

In essence, GitHub makes it easier to collaborate on coding projects, track progress, manage versions, and integrate tools for deployment and testing.
